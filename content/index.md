==========================

My name is Asta Hakala and I am a student at BTH. I am taking the course Design as part of my education in Webbprogrammering. 

I used to work as a high school teacher but decided to change my career and to get a degree in programming instead. 

I live in Norrk√∂ping with my husband, my children and our two cats. 

Things that I enjoy doing in my spare time is learning to program and taking long walks in the nature.
